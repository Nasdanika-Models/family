Prior to adulthood, one is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). Etymology The spelling of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in English has progressed over the past millennium from w?fmann to w?mmann to wumman, and finally, the modern spelling woman. In Old English, w?fmann meant &lsquo;woman&rsquo; (literally &lsquo;woman-person&rsquo;), whereas wermann meant &lsquo;man&rsquo;. Mann had a gender-neutral meaning of &lsquo;human&rsquo;, corresponding to Modern English &lsquo;person&rsquo; or &lsquo;someone&rsquo;; however, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, man began to be used more in reference to &lsquo;male human&rsquo;, and by the late 13th century it had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wer. The medial labial consonants f and m in w?fmann coalesced into the modern form &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, while the initial element w?f, which had also meant &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman (&lsquo;wife&rsquo;)."},"references/eClassifiers/Woman/inheritance.html":{"path":"Woman/Inheritance","action-uuid":"8d879c0a-feb9-4b33-9f11-28d94fbe6ec4","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "},"references/eClassifiers/Man/index.html":{"action-uuid":"16499d99-662c-43d0-a712-b29bd76ef0b5","title":"Man","content":"A man is an adult male human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). Etymology The English term &ldquo;man&rdquo; is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *man- (see Sanskrit/Avestan manu-, Slavic m?? &ldquo;man, male&rdquo;). More directly, the word derives from Old English mann. The Old English form primarily meant &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;human being&rdquo; and referred to men, women, and children alike. The Old English word for &ldquo;man&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;woman&rdquo; or &ldquo;child&rdquo; was wer. Mann only came to mean &ldquo;man&rdquo; in Middle English, replacing wer, which survives today only in the compounds &ldquo;werewolf&rdquo; (from Old English werwulf, literally &ldquo;man-wolf&rdquo;), and &ldquo;wergild&rdquo;, literally &ldquo;man-payment&rdquo;."},"demos/excel/references/members/albert/index.html":{"action-uuid":"d64ccedd-0758-4c91-a20b-3c403390d31c","title":"Albert","content":"Some documentation about Albert\n\nMultiple lines\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2"},"references/eClassifiers/Family/load-specification.html":{"path":"Family/Load specification","action-uuid":"f234d984-afef-4122-8967-d70a1582496b","title":"Load specification","content":"Load documentation with code snippets: key: value"},"index.html":{"action-uuid":"d9ec58fe-b3aa-4f41-83e7-54efca4d1793","title":"Family Model","content":"Family model is used to demonstrate different Nasdanika technologies such as: Generating of metamodel (Ecore) documentation like this one Loading of models from MS Excel and Drawio diagrams Generation of HTML sites from loaded models The model was created to mimic the model from Eclipse Sirius Basic Family tutorial.

A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth, by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation in the case of gestational surrogacy. A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation. A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support. An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child&rsquo;s parent through the legal process of adoption. A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.

The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts. In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. The plural form &ldquo;people&rdquo; is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in &ldquo;a people&rdquo;), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person.

Mapping Root -&gt; Family Diagram elements -&gt; Man or Woman Connections -&gt; Father or Mother Generation Representation element filtering Markdown documentation Embedded images PNG resource JPEG resource PNG JPEG Embedded diagrams Draw.io PlantUML Loading from a resource Inline UML Mermaid Loading from a resource Extensions Mapping Root -&gt; Family The root of the diagram is mapped to Family with the type property set to Family This documentation was generated from family.md markdown file with the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements are mapped to the root semantic element (Family) using the following feature-map: container:\n  self: \n    members:\n      argument-type: Person\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants to the members reference ordering by label. argument-type specifies that only instances of Person shall be added to the members reference. This is not really necessary to specify argument-type in this case because the members reference type is Person. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. Page name &ldquo;Sample Family&rdquo; is used to set the name of the family semantic element. Diagram elements -&gt; Man or Woman Diagram elements are mapped either to Man or Woman. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful semantic ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit diagram element ID&rsquo;s. Connections -&gt; Father or Mother Connections establish family relationships using feature-map property: source: father specifies that father feature of the connection source semantic element shall be set to the connection target semantic element. source: mother specifies that mother feature of the connection source semantic element shall be set to the connection target semantic element. source: parentsspecifies that the connection target semantic element shall be added to the parents reference of the source semantic element. target: childrenspecifies that the connection source semantic element shall be added to the children reference of the target semantic element. Generation This site was generated with 82 lines of Java code in a JUnit test. Representation element filtering Border of Isa is set during the generation with the following code: @Override\nprotected void filterRepresentationElement(\n\t\tElement representationElement, \n\t\tEObject semanticElement,\n\t\tMap&lt;EObject, EObject&gt; registry,\n\t\tProgressMonitor progressMonitor) {\n\t\t\t\t\n\t// Demo of representation filtering - adding a black border to Isa\n\tif (representationElement instanceof org.nasdanika.drawio.ModelElement) {\n\t\torg.nasdanika.drawio.ModelElement rme = (org.nasdanika.drawio.ModelElement) representationElement;\n\t\tif (&quot;isa&quot;.equals(rme.getProperty(&quot;semantic-id&quot;))) {\n\t\t\trme.getStyle().put(&quot;imageBorder&quot;, &quot;default&quot;);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n Representation filtering may be used to inject information which is not available during diagram creation or dynamic, but is available during generation.

Paul - or its variations - can be a given name or surname. Origin and diffusion The name has existed since Roman times. It derives from the Roman family name Paulus or Paullus, from the Latin adjective meaning &ldquo;small&rdquo;, &ldquo;humble&rdquo;, &ldquo;least&rdquo; or &ldquo;little&rdquo; . During the Classical Age it was used to distinguish the minor of two people of the same family bearing the same name. The Roman patrician family of the Gens Aemilia included such prominent persons as Lucius Aemilius Paullus, Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus, Tertia Aemilia Paulla (the wife of Scipio Africanus), and Sergius Paulus. Its prevalence in nations with a Christian heritage is primarily due to its attachment to Saint Paul the Apostle, whose Greek name waswas &Pi;&alpha;?&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, Pa&ucirc;los, a transliteration from the Latin, also carrying the &ldquo;modest&rdquo; meaning of this name, and chosen because of its similarity to his Jewish name &Scaron;aul. The name Paul is common, with variations, in all European languages. Paul&rsquo;s popularity has varied. In the United States, the 1990 census shows it ranked the 13th most common (male) name; however, Social Security Administration data shows popularity in the top 20 until 1968, with steadily declining use until its 2015 rank of 200th. The feminine versions are Paula, Pauline, Paulina, and Paulette."},"demos/mapping/search.html":{"action-uuid":"89384929-ab02-47dd-b1fc-092bdc4f8584","title":"Search","content":"Clear"},"demos/simple/glossary.html":{"action-uuid":"9b3f3e9c-2c24-4d17-9fe3-8632f79f55b5","title":"Glossary","content":"Clear Identifier(s) Hide UUID {{data.value.name}} {{data.value[0].value}} {{item.value}}"},"demos/simple/search.html":{"action-uuid":"e556afcc-d148-4c9a-b03e-45feac4f2d57","title":"Search","content":"Clear"},"references/eClassifiers/Family/references/eStructuralFeatures/members/index.html":{"path":"Family/References/Members","action-uuid":"e6e025da-314f-4f8a-be44-adfc4757760b","title":"Members","content":"Some documentation about family members reference"},"demos/excel/search.html":{"action-uuid":"26f4db6e-5b5a-48cf-8fb1-3230b483e032","title":"Search","content":"Clear"},"demos/simple/references/members/albert/index.html":{"action-uuid":"6ba9db73-2e50-4185-b10f-bc082c9e40af","title":"Albert","content":"Some documentation about Albert\n\nMultiple lines\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2"},"references/eClassifiers/Family/index.html":{"action-uuid":"ed8a4661-fba8-4137-8f94-2734f75a8de8","title":"Family","content":"Family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). It forms the basis for social order. The purpose of the family is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and learn to participate in the community. Historically, most human societies use family as the primary locus of attachment, nurturance, and socialization. Anthropologists classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children), patrifocal (a father and his children), conjugal (a married couple with children, also called the nuclear family), avuncular (a man, his sister, and her children), or extended (in addition to parents and children, may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins). The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history. The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics. The word &ldquo;families&rdquo; can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village."},"demos/excel/glossary.html":{"action-uuid":"55794d00-093a-432a-9708-7987bd2290a5","title":"Glossary","content":"Clear Identifier(s) Hide UUID {{data.value.name}} {{data.value[0].value}} {{item.value}}"},"references/eClassifiers/Man/inheritance.html":{"path":"Man/Inheritance","action-uuid":"8ee73a1a-f24e-403a-ac96-b77df3a80d8a","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "}}
